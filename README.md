# The-dynamics-of-the-adaptive-exponential-Integrate-and-Fire-model

This project explores the dynamics of the AdEx neuronal spiking model. 
Besides simple voltage/adaptation traces and phase portraits we also create bifurcation diagrams for certain model parameters and explore the role of chaos in the system.

Project.ipynb is the main file
parameters.py contains some example parameters which can be used to reproduce certain firing patterns
